### Hi there ‚õ≥Ô∏è

My name is James Johnson. I am a software engineer; I say that instead of front-end, back-end, or full stack because I am not any one of those more so than the others. I like building apps from the ground up. Some of them include front-ends, some of them are just an API for learning how to build one a certain way.
